/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the MediVue
 * NeoNurse application. The core philosophy is that users can only access data
 * that exists within their own dedicated data tree, identified by their unique
 * user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is hierarchically nested under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * A user's profile is stored at `/users/{userId}`, and their associated data,
 * such as hospital beds, is stored in subcollections like `/users/{userId}/beds/{bedId}`.
 * This structure provides strong, path-based security guarantees.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users are strictly isolated. They cannot read, write, or even
 *   list the data of other users. User enumeration is explicitly disallowed by
 *   denying list access on the top-level `/users` collection.
 * - Ownership Integrity: For any document created within a user's data tree,
 *   the rules enforce that the document's internal data contains a field
 *   (e.g., `userId`) that matches the user ID in the path. This creates a durable
 *   and verifiable ownership link.
 * - Default Secure: Access is denied by default. Permissions must be explicitly
 *   granted through these rules. Write operations are never left open.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure fast and secure authorization, the `Bed` documents under a user's
 * subcollection contain a denormalized `userId` field. This allows the security
 * rules to verify ownership directly from the document being accessed, avoiding
 * slow and costly `get()` calls to parent documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model uses structural segregation by placing each user's private data
 * (like their list of beds) into a dedicated subcollection under their own user
 * document. This is more secure and performant for list operations than a single
 * global collection, as it allows rules to grant list access based on the path.
